This plugin provides a link on the Manage Templates screen labeled 
"Send to Publish Queue." When clicked, the user will have the choice
to send every template to the publish queue to be published later.
Once the job is complete, another cleanup task will go through and
email interested parties when publishing is complete.

This plugin was conceived to help speed up the process of rebuilding
an entire blog immediately after a deployment. The plugin will instruct
MT to update every file, but will send every file to the publish 
queue regardless of its settings.

Send to Publish Queue can also be used to republish many blogs: visit System 
Overview > Blogs, select the blogs you'd like republished, and choose "Send to
Publish Queue" from the List Actions.
